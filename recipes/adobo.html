    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Chicken Adobo is a type of <strong>Filipino chicken stew</strong>. Chicken pieces are <em>marinated in soy sauce and spices, pan-fried, and stewed</em> until tender. The dish gained popularity because of its delicious taste and ease in preparation.
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 bone-in, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>⅔ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, then turn over and cook an additional 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour off all but 1 tbsp. of pan drippings and return pan to low heat. Add garlic and sauté until soft, about 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and stir to incorporate. Return chicken to pan and cook, covered, for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover, increase heat to medium-low and cook 15 to 20 minutes more, occasionally spooning sauce over chicken, until sauce thickens a bit and chicken is tender and nicely glazed with sauce. Remove bay leaf before eating.</li>
    </ol>
